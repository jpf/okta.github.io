## Overview

The Okta Event API provides read access to your organization's system log. The API is intended to export event data as a batch job from your organization to another system for reporting or analysis.

## Event Model

Every organization has a system log that maintains a history of actions performed by users.  The Event model describes a single action that was performed by a set of actors for a set of targets.

### Example

~~~ json

   "eventId":"tevGr2BhQTMR72OiBGvKXTp2Q1399593071000",
   "published":"2014-05-08T23:51:11.000Z",
   "requestId":"req8U_MHmEbSai_0I4RopTnfA",
   "sessionId":"000cWiYg47QSFyk1YjE6cDcEg",
   "action":{
      "message":"Okta user created",

### Attributes

The Event model is a ***read-only*** object and has a fixed set of attributes:

Attribute | Description | DataType | Nullable
---- | --- | --- | ---
eventId | Unique key for event | String | FALSE
published | Timestamp when event was published | Date | TRUE
requestId | Identifies the request | String | TRUE
sessionId | Session in which the event occurred | String | TRUE
action | Identifies the action that the event describes | [Action Object](#action-object) | FALSE
actors | Describes zero or more entities that performed the action | Array of [Actor Object](#actor-object) | TRUE
targets | Describes zero or more entities that the action was performed against | Array of [Target Object](#target-object) | TRUE

> The actor and/or target of an event is dependent on the action performed. Not all events have an actor or target.

> A single requestID can identify multiple events.

> The sessionID can identify multiple requests. Use the sessionID to link events and requests that occurred in the same session.


### Action Object

Describes an activity that published an event

Attribute | Description | DataType | Nullable
--- | --- | --- | ---
message | Description of an action | String | FALSE
categories | [Categories](#action-categories) for an action | Array of String | FALSE
objectType | Identifies the [unique type](#action-objecttypes) of an action | String | FALSE
requestUri | Uri of the request that generated the event. | String | TRUE

> Actions that do not define any categories will have an zero element array value.
